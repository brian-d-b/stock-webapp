## Stock-Webapp

I created [https://brians-stock.app/](https://brians-stock.app/) as a quick, start-from-scratch project to learn:
- **Javascript,Typescript, and React**
- **Google Cloud** Run, Functions, and Storage
- **Docker**
- **DNS Records** (Mapping the Container to -> brians-stock.app)

React, Javascript, and more about cloud hosting by using Docker, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions to create this website.

The front-end is a little basic, but it gets the job done for now.
